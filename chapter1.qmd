**THE ARCHES OF PURANA QILA : ECHOES THE PAINS OF PARTITION**

***"Hindustan had become free. Pakistan had become independent soon
after its inception, but man was still a slave in both these
countries—slave of prejudice ... slave of religious fanaticism ... slave
of barbarity and inhumanity." - Sadat Hasan Manto***

These words of Manto reflect the agony,distress,despair and anger of
millions of people displaced in the partition of india. Estimated 18
million people displaced and million died, those who displaced assumed a
new identity as they crossed the border. Partition created\
one of the biggest refugee crises in the history of mankind. Delhi was
one of the hotspots for millions of refugees. Several refugee camps were
established around the whole city. Gulzar's reflection of partition
describes *"I clearly remember the pain of partition; the whole of Delhi
was seeing the struggle of refugees. We stayed near Roshanara Bagh and
the whole city appeared like a refugee camp"* . One of the significant
refugee camps established in Delhi was at the Purana Qila. Purana Qila
during 1947- 1948 sheltered muslims threatened from communal violence in
the city. Later during 1948-63 , lakhs of hindu and sikh refugees lived
in the tent camps of Purana Qila.

**PURANA QILA BEFORE PARTITION**

Purana Qila , one of the oldest forts in delhi, speaks about the long ;
rich and vibrant ; culture and history of delhi. The fort structure as
it stands today was built under the reign of mughal emperor Humayun and
Afghan ruler Sher Shah suri. According to legends ,it is believed to
have been built on the site of the ancient city Indraprastha mentioned
in Hindu epic Mahabharata. Archaeological evidences suggest occupation
of this site since Mauryan period, it continued in Gupta and later in
Mughals, suggesting a long history of occupation .The fort include the
Qila-i-Kuhna mosque built under Sher Shah Suri and the Sher Mandal (an
octagonal tower) under Humayun. During the British era , the site was
used for military camps and recreational purposes. During world war II
,the Purana Qila was used to house 2,115 japanese civilians internees
arrested from across british ruled south east asia.

One of the largest refugee camps was at the ancient fort of Purana Qila
where refugees from all walks of life camped "with their camels and
tongas and ponies, battered old taxis and luxury limousines", wrote
eyewitness Richard Symonds as quoted in Yasmin Khan's book ' The Great
Partition'.

September 1947,will be remembered by Delhi residents as a period of
horror called " September Massacre ' of Delhi. The communal violence in
Delhi forced thousands of muslims to take shelter in the monuments of
Delhi. Purana Qila was initially a camp for government employees and
soon became a refugee camp for muslims escaping communal violence in
their neighbourhoods. In early October around 60,000 - 80,000 muslim
refugees were housed in Purana Qila camp, waiting to find their way to
Pakistan. Anees Kidwai who who worked for the peace and rehabilitation
of victims of bloody partition,\
wrote - `"there was as far as the eye could see nothing but disorganised
tents and heaps of tent roofs amidst which naked children, unkempt
women, girls without their heads covered and men overcame with anger
wandered up and down endlessly"` . People were struggling to find food
and water in the camp area. The fort,once a symbol of royal grandeur,
had become a site of sorrow and despair . Disease and death were rampant
and hope was scarce.

In 1948, the ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation suspended the
monumentality of the site to allow their temporary transformation into
refugee camps. Later during 1948- 63, Hindus and Sikhs refugees
displaced from their homes in Pakistan took shelter in Purana Qila
refugee camps .

Milkha Singh was one of the refugees who took shelter at camps in Purana
Qila. In his autobiography"The Race of My Life " he wrote,`"I saw my
parents, siblings, and relatives being butchered before my eyes. The
images of their bodies, lifeless and mutilated, haunted me for years."`
His reflections of life in refugee camps convey the immense
hardship,loss ,pain and trauma of millions displaced from their
homeland, family and friends. Historian Urvashi Butalia and Ravinder
Kaur in their writings highlighted the differences of experiences and
treatments of marginalised castes groups , women and children in relief
camps.

**RESTORATION OF MONUMENT**

During 1947-1963 ,the fort, having housed thousands of displaced people
, had suffered significant damage to the fort's structures. Aditi
Chandra in her article" Potential of the ‘Un-Exchangeable Monument’:
Delhi’s Purana Qila, in the time of Partition, c.1947–63 " writes - "the
simple presence of the refugees and their actions of daily living in the
camp resulted in the Purana Qila losing its status as a picturesque
tourist-monument from 1947 to 1963".Initially ASI had permitted refugees
to camp inside the fort . However, by early 1948 ASI protested against
this occupation concerning damage to aesthetic upkeep of the monument of
national importance.The ASI complained that refugees were cutting down
trees and burying their dead within Purana Qila. When housing facilities
were offered to hindu and sikh refugees, they stubbornly refused to move
out of the Purana Qila to escape the rent. The unsanitary rent-free
housing in the Old Fort was preferred over shoddy government housing for
which rent would have to be paid, for people who had lost everything in
the Partition. Finally, in November 1963, all the refugees housed in
Purana Qila were evicted by administration and ASI efforts. The
restoration work began on key structures, gates and walls of Purana
Qila. Alongside restoration,the ASI conducted archaeological excavations
to discover and document the historical layers of Purana Qila site. The
excavations at Purana Qila have provided concrete evidence of continuous
habitation over thousands of years, showcasing Delhi's historical depth
and significance.

**CONCLUSION**

Architecture houses the stories and experiences of our past that guides
our present. The discussion of life in refugee camps at Purana Qila
provides us a mirror to look into the miseries and trauma of partition.
These stories and experiences during the partition of soul teach us
about human resilience and the cost of religious fanaticism. Today a
popular tourist destination in Delhi, Purana Qila, stands as a mirror
that reflects the stories of our heritage and history. The face of this
fort teaches us to honour the experiences of partition and the cost of
independent India. The fort guides the visitor to learn from the\
experience of the past and live in peace and harmony.
