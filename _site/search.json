Pakistan had become independent soon after its inception, but man was still a slave in both these countries—slave of prejudice … slave of religious fanaticism … slave of barbarity and inhumanity.” - Sadat Hasan Manto\nThese words of Manto reflect the agony,distress,despair and anger of millions of people displaced in the partition of india. Estimated 18 million people displaced and million died, those who displaced assumed a new identity as they crossed the border. Partition created\none of the biggest refugee crises in the history of mankind. Delhi was one of the hotspots for millions of refugees. Several refugee camps were established around the whole city. Gulzar’s reflection of partition describes “I clearly remember the pain of partition; the whole of Delhi was seeing the struggle of refugees. We stayed near Roshanara Bagh and the whole city appeared like a refugee camp” . One of the significant refugee camps established in Delhi was at the Purana Qila. Purana Qila during 1947- 1948 sheltered muslims threatened from communal violence in the city. Later during 1948-63 , lakhs of hindu and sikh refugees lived in the tent camps of Purana Qila.\n\n\n\nPURANA QILA\n\n\nImage Source- Incredible India\nPURANA QILA BEFORE PARTITION\nPurana Qila , one of the oldest forts in delhi, speaks about the long ; rich and vibrant ; culture and history of delhi. The fort structure as it stands today was built under the reign of mughal emperor Humayun and Afghan ruler Sher Shah suri. According to legends ,it is believed to have been built on the site of the ancient city Indraprastha mentioned in Hindu epic Mahabharata. Archaeological evidences suggest occupation of this site since Mauryan period, it continued in Gupta and later in Mughals, suggesting a long history of occupation .The fort include the Qila-i-Kuhna mosque built under Sher Shah Suri and the Sher Mandal (an octagonal tower) under Humayun. During the British era , the site was used for military camps and recreational purposes. During world war II ,the Purana Qila was used to house 2,115 japanese civilians internees arrested from across british ruled south east asia.\nREFUGEE CAMP AT PURANA QILA\n\n\n\nRefugee Camp ,Purana Qila\n\n\nImage source - Wall Street Journal\nOne of the largest refugee camps was at the ancient fort of Purana Qila where refugees from all walks of life camped “with their camels and tongas and ponies, battered old taxis and luxury limousines”, wrote eyewitness Richard Symonds as quoted in Yasmin Khan’s book ’ The Great Partition’.\nSeptember 1947,will be remembered by Delhi residents as a period of horror called ” September Massacre ’ of Delhi. The communal violence in Delhi forced thousands of muslims to take shelter in the monuments of Delhi. Purana Qila was initially a camp for government employees and soon became a refugee camp for muslims escaping communal violence in their neighbourhoods. In early October around 60,000 - 80,000 muslim refugees were housed in Purana Qila camp, waiting to find their way to Pakistan. Anees Kidwai who who worked for the peace and rehabilitation of victims of bloody partition,\nwrote - \"there was as far as the eye could see nothing but disorganised tents and heaps of tent roofs amidst which naked children, unkempt women, girls without their heads covered and men overcame with anger wandered up and down endlessly\" . People were struggling to find food and water in the camp area. The fort,once a symbol of royal grandeur, had become a site of sorrow and despair . Disease and death were rampant and hope was scarce.\nIn 1948, the ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation suspended the monumentality of the site to allow their temporary transformation into refugee camps. Later during 1948- 63, Hindus and Sikhs refugees displaced from their homes in Pakistan took shelter in Purana Qila refugee camps .\nMilkha Singh was one of the refugees who took shelter at camps in Purana Qila. In his autobiography”The Race of My Life ” he wrote,\"I saw my parents, siblings, and relatives being butchered before my eyes. The images of their bodies, lifeless and mutilated, haunted me for years.\" His reflections of life in refugee camps convey the immense hardship,loss ,pain and trauma of millions displaced from their homeland, family and friends. Historian Urvashi Butalia and Ravinder Kaur in their writings highlighted the differences of experiences and treatments of marginalised castes groups , women and children in relief camps.\nRESTORATION OF MONUMENT\nDuring 1947-1963 ,the fort, having housed thousands of displaced people , had suffered significant damage to the fort’s structures. Aditi Chandra in her article” Potential of the ‘Un-Exchangeable Monument’: Delhi’s Purana Qila, in the time of Partition, c.1947–63 ” writes - “the simple presence of the refugees and their actions of daily living in the camp resulted in the Purana Qila losing its status as a picturesque tourist-monument from 1947 to 1963”.Initially ASI had permitted refugees to camp inside the fort . However, by early 1948 ASI protested against this occupation concerning damage to aesthetic upkeep of the monument of national importance.The ASI complained that refugees were cutting down trees and burying their dead within Purana Qila. When housing facilities were offered to hindu and sikh refugees, they stubbornly refused to move out of the Purana Qila to escape the rent. The unsanitary rent-free housing in the Old Fort was preferred over shoddy government housing for which rent would have to be paid, for people who had lost everything in the Partition. Finally, in November 1963, all the refugees housed in Purana Qila were evicted by administration and ASI efforts. The restoration work began on key structures, gates and walls of Purana Qila. Alongside restoration,the ASI conducted archaeological excavations to discover and document the historical layers of Purana Qila site. The excavations at Purana Qila have provided concrete evidence of continuous habitation over thousands of years, showcasing Delhi’s historical depth and significance.\nCONCLUSION\nArchitecture houses the stories and experiences of our past that guides our present. The discussion of life in refugee camps at Purana Qila provides us a mirror to look into the miseries and trauma of partition. These stories and experiences during the partition of soul teach us about human resilience and the cost of religious fanaticism. Today a popular tourist destination in Delhi, Purana Qila, stands as a mirror that reflects the stories of our heritage and history. The face of this fort teaches us to honour the experiences of partition and the cost of independent India. The fort guides the visitor to learn from the\nexperience of the past and live in peace and harmony.\nSources and References\n1.KUMARI, AMITA. “Delhi as Refuge: Resettlement and Assimilation of Partition Refugees.” Economic and Political Weekly 48, no. 44 (2013): 60–67. http://www.jstor.org/stable/23528808.\n2.Chandra, A.
